            <p>Testimonials:</br>
                <br>"For those looking to experience the edge of death, and excellent on scrambled eggs."</br>
                <br>"Did you just give me bear mace?"</br>
                <br>I’ve made a couple different kinds of hot sauce at this point and this is probably my favorite. 
                I've made some variation of the sauce every August for the last four years. It’s smoky, flavorful,
                and potent, and really, who can resist that combination? 
                <br>Now, I know fermenting your own foods sounds mildly alarming and perhaps labor intensive, but if you're
                careful about cleanliness and efficent, it's really not. It produces flavor and nutrition that are well worth it,
                and it's one of the oldest methods of perservation out there. If you've never fermented anything before and would like some
                reassurance you aren't going to die, here's some recommended read: <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com
                /2014/03/fermenting-veggies-at-home-follow-food-safety-abcs/#.WbWkvhmGNEY">"Fermenting Veggies at Home: Follow Food 
                Safety ABCs"</a> (though I disagree with some of it; unless youre buying from a farmer's market or are using your own produce,
                it's possible that the vegetables have be stripped of their natural biofilm, where the critters we want live, so you'll want a 
                starter); <a href="http://phickle.com/getting-started-and-faq/">Getting Started with Fermentation"</a>; <a href=""></a>. 
                I also recommend the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/">r/fermentation subreddit</a> as an excellent source of information.
                <br>You'll also definitely want to read up on food safety for canning. <a href="https://www.extension.umn.edu
                /food/food-safety/preserving/canning/">"Canning"</a> from the University of Minnesota Extension is a great guide. I favor
                the boiling water bath as a method of sealing my jars.

           kettle-grill.html">Here</a> are directions for setting up a charcoal grill as a smoker. I usually
           stack some wood under the coals as well. <a href="http://www.dantesdevine.com/pages/Smoking-Woods.html">
               Here's</a> a list of good smoking woods, though I would add that you can use rosewood as well 
               (the flavor is similar to applewood, but lighter) because that's what I prefer to use.
               <a href="https://www.101cookingfortwo.com/set-gas-grill-smoking-low-slow-cooking/">You can smoke on a
               gas grill as well</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitles">Directions</h2>
            <div class="bullets">
                <li>Start your charcoal, if your setup requires that, and arrange your grill as per the directions
                in the above links.</li>
                <li>Wash your chilies and put on your plastic gloves. Slice the cap off the peppers. You may also
                deseed and devein the chilies if you would like to cut down on the heat, but I would enlist a helper to cut down
                on prep time if you're going to do that. Weigh your peppers and note it down somewhere.</li>
                <li>Layer the peppers on the mesh screen. You can do this in layers if you'd like to be efficent.
                Smoke them for a few hours -- how long that will be depends on how smoky you want the final product.
                I usually do it for about two or three hours and then switch them for fresh ones. You don't have to
                smoke all of the peppers if you don't want to. I didn't this last time. You can also smoke the salt
                on a layer of aluminum if you'd like to. Just make sure you stir it around occasionally.</li>
                <li>Slice your onions into thin rings and mash your garlic. Weigh them, along with your spices, and add that
                to the total weight of your peppers.</li>
                <li>Carefully wash your jar and the lid, or whatever you happen to be using to ferment. You can run
                it through the dishwash if you like, or you can use a round of soap followed by a bit of diluted
                bleach. If you do the latter, rinse it and the lid for a couple minutes to get all the bleach out.</li>
                <li>Calculate 5% of the total weight of all your ingridents and measure out that much salt.</li>
                <li>Add the peppers and an eyeballed half of your salt into the jar and stir around.</li>
                <li>Drop the garlic into the jar and then layer your onion rings on top of that. Drop the rest of the salt on top and your starter, too.</li>
                <li> Place your fermentation weights into the jar. Or, if you're using a plastic bag, put the bag inside
                the jar while empty and fill it with water. Arrange it so all the onions are kept in place by the bag.</li>
                <li> Fill the just with water until you've reached about the halfway point on the bag. </li>
                <li>Rapidly spin the jar on the counter (being careful not to dislodge the onions and the rest of the mash) to get the air bubbles out. </li>
                <li>Screw the lid on hand tight and place someplace warmish and out of direct sunlight.</li>
                <li>Losen the lid twice a day and gently spin it again to knock out air bubbles for a week (this is called burping). T
                he most aggressive fermentation will take place during this period.</li>
                <li>Keep an eye on the jar and burp it once in a while if you think it needs it, but mostly leave it alone. How long
                you chose to let it go will depend on your tastes. I generally don't even bother to taste test it for at least three 
                months.</li>
                <li>When you've decided it's done, break out the slow cooker and fill it with half of the mash. Cover the mash with at
                least an inch of water and set it on low for 24 hours. Reserve some of the brine in a jar in the fridge if you want
                to reinoculate the sauce with critters and store the remaining mash in the fridge. I would put it outside or in your garage because it can get a litte...nerve gassy
                sometimes. KEEP AN EYE ON THE WATER LEVEL. I lost half my batch last year because I didn't do that with the second round.
                </li>
                <li>Cycle out your cooked mash for the other half. Again, watch your water levels and add more as neccesary.  </li>
                <li>Put the cooked half through a food processor if you like your sauce chunky or a foodmill if you want a smooth sauce.</li>
                <li>Put half of your canning jars and lids through the dishwasher or boil them for 10 minutes (put a wire rack or a clean 
                dishtowel on the botton of the pot!). Ideally, you've got a canning funnel but if you don't, no worries. A plain old funnel will
                work, too. Use a sterlized measuring cup to fill the jars, leaving an inch of headroom. 
                    <br>If you intend to reinoculate your sauce, let both it and the jars you want to use cool and put a spoonful of your reserved brine
                    in each
                    jar. For the sake of food safety, I would only do this for jars you intend to keep in the fridge. If you plan to store it,
                    don't.</li>
                <li>Follow the directions for a boiling water bath from the guide in the first part of the post.</li>
