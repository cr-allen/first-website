            <p>Testimonials:</br>
                <br>"For those looking to experience the edge of death, and excellent on scrambled eggs."</br>
                <br>"Did you just give me bear mace?"</br>
                <br>I’ve made a couple different kinds of hot sauce at this point and this is probably my favorite. 
                I've made some variation of the sauce every August for the last four years. It’s smoky, flavorful,
                and potent, and really, who can resist that combination? 
                <br>Now, I know fermenting your own foods sounds mildly alarming and perhaps labor intensive, but if you're
                careful about cleanliness and efficent, it's really not. It produces flavor and nutrition that are well worth it,
                and it's one of the oldest methods of perservation out there. If you've never fermented anything before and would like some
                reassurance you aren't going to die, here's some recommended read: <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com
                /2014/03/fermenting-veggies-at-home-follow-food-safety-abcs/#.WbWkvhmGNEY">"Fermenting Veggies at Home: Follow Food 
                Safety ABCs"</a> (though I disagree with some of it; unless youre buying from a farmer's market or are using your own produce,
                it's possible that the vegetables have be stripped of their natural biofilm, where the critters we want live, so you'll want a 
                starter); <a href="http://phickle.com/getting-started-and-faq/">Getting Started with Fermentation"</a>; <a href=""></a>. 
                I also recommend the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/">r/fermentation subreddit</a> as an excellent source of information.

           kettle-grill.html">Here</a> are directions for setting up a charcoal grill as a smoker. I usually
           stack some wood under the coals as well. <a href="http://www.dantesdevine.com/pages/Smoking-Woods.html">
               Here's</a> a list of good smoking woods, though I would add that you can use rosewood as well 
               (the flavor is similar to applewood, but lighter) because that's what I prefer to use.
               <a href="https://www.101cookingfortwo.com/set-gas-grill-smoking-low-slow-cooking/">You can smoke on a
               gas grill as well</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitles">Directions</h2>
            <div class="bullets">
                <li>Start your charcoal, if your setup requires that, and arrange your grill as per the directions
                in the above links.</li>
                <li>Wash your chilies and put on your plastic gloves. Slice the cap off the peppers. You may also
                deseed and devein the chilies if you would like to cut down on the heat, but I would enlist a helper to cut down
                on prep time if you're going to do that. Weigh your peppers and note it down somewhere.</li>
                <li>Layer the peppers on the mesh screen. You can do this in layers if you'd like to be efficent.
                Smoke them for a few hours -- how long that will be depends on how smoky you want the final product.
                I usually do it for about two or three hours and then switch them for fresh ones. You don't have to
                smoke all of the peppers if you don't want to. I didn't this last time. You can also smoke the salt
                on a layer of aluminum if you'd like to. Just make sure you stir it around occasionally.</li>
                <li>Chop your onions and mash your garlic. Weigh them, along with your spices, and add that
                to the total weight of your peppers.</li>
                <li>Carefully wash your jar and the lid, or whatever you happen to be using to ferment. You can run
                it through the dishwash if you like, or you can use a round of soap followed by a bit of diluted
                bleach. If you do the latter, rinse it for a couple minutes to get all the bleach out.</li>
                <li>Calculate 5% of the total weight of all your ingridents and measure out that much salt.</li>
                <li>Dump the salt and onions/etc. into your jar and stir around. The salt will begin to draw
                the water out of the onions and garlic.</li>
                <li></li>
